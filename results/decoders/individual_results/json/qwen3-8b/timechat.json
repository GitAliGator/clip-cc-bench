    "reference": " The video begins with a bespectacled man in a white shirt driving a car while speaking. The camera cuts to a black sedan driving down the street, with someone in the passenger seat firing a weapon out of the window. The scene transitions back to the bespectacled man, who now appears increasingly restless. A man in a yellow suit occupies the passenger seat, and there seems to be another individual in the backseat. The focus shifts to the street, where a turquoise sedan is being pursued by the black sedan. A passenger in the black sedan continues firing. The camera returns to the bespectacled man, who is driving anxiously, and pans to the man in the yellow suit as he opens the glove box and retrieves an object. It is revealed to be a gun, which he holds in his hand. The bespectacled man, appearing frustrated, speaks while driving. The two men argue loudly as the camera alternates between them. The turquoise sedan is shown speeding down the street, with pedestrians taking cover. Meanwhile, the black sedan continues its pursuit. The camera briefly focuses on a man wearing a hat in the backseat of the black sedan, who is yelling. It then pans back to the man in the yellow suit, now seen with his feet up on the dashboard, as the vehicles race through the streets. The focus shifts again to the turquoise sedan, capturing both its interior and exterior. Inside the car, the bespectacled man and the man in the yellow suit switch places, with the latter now taking the driver’s seat. The windshield wipers move back and forth as the turquoise sedan continues down the road. The bespectacled man, now in the passenger seat, fires a weapon toward the pursuing black sedan. In the backseat, the man with the hat is shown screaming. The camera returns to the black sedan, where the passenger leans out of the window and continues firing. Meanwhile, the man in the yellow suit, visibly anxious, drives the turquoise sedan while speaking. The street view changes, showing a blue sedan on the left of the turquoise sedan. A side angle shot captures the speeding vehicles, followed by an aerial perspective of the chase. The focus shifts to a black sedan parked in the middle of the street. Inside the turquoise sedan, the bespectacled man and the man in the yellow suit are seen arguing. The scene transitions to a video game-like mode, displaying speed annotations (in mph) and a score in the top-right corner. The video game perspective shows the street, including pedestrians on the curb. The camera then captures the turquoise sedan from the perspective of a man in sunglasses inside a parked car. This man, holding a gun, begins firing while another individual occupies the driver’s seat. The turquoise sedan swerves erratically, driving on the wrong side of the road and drifting uncontrollably. Inside, the man with the hat lies in the backseat, screaming. The focus shifts to two black sedans. One of them speeds past a black sedan parked in the middle of the street, running a red light in the process. The chase intensifies as the black sedan pulls up parallel to the turquoise sedan on its left. Inside the turquoise sedan, the man in the yellow suit turns the steering wheel sharply toward the black sedan.  The camera captures a red SUV parked on the right side of the street, with a man in a white shirt standing nearby on the curb. The black sedan crashes into the red SUV, causing an explosion and shattering glass. The bespectacled man, now in the passenger seat of the turquoise sedan, looks back at the scene, while the man in the yellow suit continues driving. The video concludes with a shot of the turquoise sedan speeding down the street as the black sedan, engulfed in flames, is shown mid-air.",

He is speaking while holding an object, with a lamp hanging from the ceiling in front of him.The camera returns to a close-up of the woman’s face with the instrument holding her eyelids, showing her moving her eyes laterally. It then zooms in on what appears to be a laser machine with a bright, reflective surface. The scene shifts back to the woman’s face, focusing on the eyelid-holding instrument again. The doctor is then shown holding an instrument in his right hand and looking into it with one eye. The focus alternates between the instrument holding the eyelids and the face of the teddy bear, which someone is squeezing with both hands.

He reads aloud, punches some buttons on a machine to his right, and the camera provides a close-up of the keyboard as he does so. The doctor is then shown holding multiple files in both hands, reading and talking. Behind him, a monitor displays a close-up of the instrument holding the woman’s eyelids. The doctor says something before standing up, walking out of the operating theater, and closing the door behind him. The woman remains lying on the surgical table, still holding the teddy bear with both hands. A small table is visible on her right side.The camera transitions to a disposable cup on the edge of a water dispenser. The cup falls, spilling water that flows toward a wall socket. The green light on the socket turns red. Another wall-mounted instrument with a green light also turns red and begins sparking. The camera follows a pipe leading from the wall-mounted instrument to a machine with a screen and keyboard. The screen displays a warning: 'NOT TO EXCEED 5mW,' with '4.6 mW' shown in red beneath it. The numbers increase to 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, and finally 5.2.The video concludes with the woman lying on the surgical table, appearing distressed and speaking while a monitor on her right displays an image of her eye.",
