The camera cuts to a black sedan driving down the street, with someone in the passenger seat firing a weapon out of the window. The scene transitions back to the bespectacled man, who now appears increasingly restless. A man in a yellow suit occupies the passenger seat, and there seems to be another individual in the backseat. The focus shifts to the street, where a turquoise sedan is being pursued by the black sedan. A passenger in the black sedan continues firing. The camera returns to the bespectacled man, who is driving anxiously, and pans to the man in the yellow suit as he opens the glove box and retrieves an object. It is revealed to be a gun, which he holds in his hand. The bespectacled man, appearing frustrated, speaks while driving. The two men argue loudly as the camera alternates between them. The turquoise sedan is shown speeding down the street, with pedestrians taking cover. Meanwhile, the black sedan continues its pursuit. The camera briefly focuses on a man wearing a hat in the backseat of the black sedan, who is yelling.

Inside the turquoise sedan, the bespectacled man and the man in the yellow suit are seen arguing. The scene transitions to a video game-like mode, displaying speed annotations (in mph) and a score in the top-right corner. The video game perspective shows the street, including pedestrians on the curb. The camera then captures the turquoise sedan from the perspective of a man in sunglasses inside a parked car. This man, holding a gun, begins firing while another individual occupies the driver’s seat. The turquoise sedan swerves erratically, driving on the wrong side of the road and drifting uncontrollably. Inside, the man with the hat lies in the backseat, screaming. The focus shifts to two black sedans. One of them speeds past a black sedan parked in the middle of the street, running a red light in the process. The chase intensifies as the black sedan pulls up parallel to the turquoise sedan on its left. Inside the turquoise sedan, the man in the yellow suit turns the steering wheel sharply toward the black sedan.  The camera captures a red SUV parked on the right side of the street, with a man in a white shirt standing nearby on the curb. The black sedan crashes into the red SUV, causing an explosion and shattering glass. The bespectacled man, now in the passenger seat of the turquoise sedan, looks back at the scene, while the man in the yellow suit continues driving.
